# The Resume Builder Project
	- Audience: job applicants, HS and college students
	- Users will choose a resume template, input prompted information, and receive a Word document of their resume

# USER STORIES (Implemented)
	- A user should be able to choose a template
	- A user should be able to enter their work experience
	- A user should be able to enter their extracurriculars
	- A user should be able to enter their contact info
	- A user should be able to enter their education experience
	- A user should be able to enter their skills

# USER STORIES (To-dos and In Progress)
	- A user should be able to enter their skills (depending on the template)
	- A user should be able to enter their information in any order
	- A user should be able to choose from a variety of templates (standard resume, HS resume, undergrad research, federal resume, technical resume, CV)
	- A user should be able to receive a file of their resume (cwd, user chooses a directory, or emailed the file)

# Obstacles/Issues
	- nextLine() with scanner caused issues in the Menu class, will need revisit this issue
	- Rethinking resume menu structure to prompt for user information in the order the user chooses, rather than requesting all the necessary instance variables for object instantiation

# Running the Program from the Command Line
	- See run_resume_builder.sh
